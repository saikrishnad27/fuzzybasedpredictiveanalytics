Influenza is major promising and reemerging contagious diseases, causing high morbidity
and mortality throughout the worldwide. Influenza is also called as Swine flu, hoard flu,
pig flu. A major challenge for health care system is to be providing a diagnostic product
services at low costs and to diagnosing patients accurately. The use of data analytics and
machine learning is a breakthrough technology that can have a significant impact in
healthcare field. Machine learning methods can be used for diseases identification because
it mainly apply on data themselves and gives priority to outcomes of certain task. In this
work, we propose a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) to generate the fuzzy
rules to be used in the knowledge-based system. We test our proposed method on several
public medical datasets. Results on Swine flu data show that proposed method remarkably
improves the diseases prediction accuracy. The results showed that the combinat ion of
fuzzy rule-based, CART with noise removal techniques can be effective in diseases
prediction. The knowledge-based system can assist medical practitioners in the healthcare
practice as a clinical analytical method.

Proposed system: 

In this method, classification algorithms for Machine Learning and their theoretical
context are addressed to classify the patients with swine flu. We addressed Fuzzy logic and
CART, both together on the techniques of machine learning to gain an advantage over output.
The Fuzzy inference approach is built on the Fuzzy set theory, Fuzzy if then laws including
Fuzzy logic principles. Fuzzy if-then the arrangement of rules constitutes the main component
of Fuzzy inference system, is a very general methodology and has been commonly used in
various fields such as data processing, automated monitoring, understanding of the system,
pattern recognition, object detection, etc. The basic architecture for a fuzzy inference method
is constructed of three key components: A law basis consisting of the chosen fuzzy rules, a
database detailing the membership features of the fuzzy rules, and a logic process
implementing a fuzzy statement inference the rules such that a rational result or conclusion
may be drawn.
